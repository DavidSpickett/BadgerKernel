# Badger Kernel Demos

The documents linked below give an overview of how the demos work and explain some mechanisms in these demos.

For the best understanding we suggest that you:
* read the document and demo source side by side
* make some changes to the demo to verify its behaviour
* follow it in the debugger with `make debug_<demo>` (see [debugging.md](debugging.md) for more details)
